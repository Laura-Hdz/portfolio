           <h2>Graphic designer who loves esports & web design</h2>
           <p>Hi! I’m a graphic designer and esports fan based in Montreal who enjoys working on publication, promotional and web design projects. I have developed a strong sense of punctuality, teamwork and problem-solving skills that stem from successfully working under tight deadlines and a variety of collaborative projects. As an avid gamer, I’ve become highly involved in the world of esports, both as a viewer and a participant—I’m now looking to use my design skills to help this industry grow. If you would like to work together or simply join me in a game of League of Legends (or even introduce me to a new game!), please don’t hesitate to contact me at hdzc.laura@gmail.com.</p>
